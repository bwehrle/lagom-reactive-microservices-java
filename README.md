# Introduction

This is a simple project used to demonstrate the implementation of microservices in Lagom.  
It is a work in progress.

This project was generated by the lagom/lagom-java.g8 template and I added new service implementations.  Some of the changes I've introduced are:

* Simplify boilerplate code with Lambok
* Use "Command" convention for naming the requests to Persistent Entities


# Ideas
* Add in introspection for logging and visibility events and command
* Kotlin generator

For instructions on running and testing the project, see https://www.lagomframework.com/get-started-java-sbt.html.
